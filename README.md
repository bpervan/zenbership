Work on Zenbership v2 Has Begun!
================================

**I am thrilled to announce that work on Zenbership v2 has begun! The process will be ongoing for some time, but you can follow along with the [progress here](http://zenbership.org/zen2.html).**

Zenbership Membership Software
==============================

Zenbership is open source membership software written in PHP that combines event planning, CRM, a CMS, invoicing,
subscription management, marketing tools (like e-mail campaigns), a shopping cart, and secure content delivery.

Notice of Deprecation
=====================

While the software will still run on most servers, note that support and updates for the product have been suspended since 2018. Work did begin on Zenbership v2 but that was sidelined due to a lack of time and a failed Kickstarter. As of March 2020, there are no plans continue development on the software.
